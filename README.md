## 🚀 Why Catnip?

Catnip's purpose is to make developing with AI more accessible and productive.

- **🔒 Isolated Sandbox**: All code runs containerized environment using either Docker or Apple's new [Container SDK](https://github.com/apple/container). We can use --dangerously-skip-permissions without fear!
- **🧑‍💻 Worktree Management**: Worktree's let you spawn multiple agents in parallel. Catnip keeps everything organized.
- **💻 Full Terminal Access**: Open multiple terminals via the web interface, CLI, or directly via SSH.
- **👀 Preview Changes**: Catnip has a built in proxy and port detection. Start a web service and preview it live!
- **🌐 Universal Access**: Still a big fan of Cursor or VS Code? No problem, full remote development directly in your IDE is supported.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
curl -sSfL install.catnip.sh | sh
catnip run
# Open http://localhost:8080 🎉
```

## 🤓 How it works

`catnip` is a golang binary with a vite SPA embedded within it. The `wandb/catnip` container was inspired by the [openai/codex-universal](https://github.com/openai/codex-universal) container.

It comes pre-configured with node, python, golang, gcc, and rust. You can have the container install a different version of the language on boot by setting any of these environment variables:

```bash
# Set specific language versions
CATNIP_NODE_VERSION=20.11.0
CATNIP_PYTHON_VERSION=3.12
CATNIP_RUST_VERSION=1.75.0
CATNIP_GO_VERSION=1.22
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the future we intend to support custom base images.

### Environment Setup

Catnip currently looks for a file named `setup.sh` in the root of your repo and runs it when a workspace is created. This is a great place to run `pnpm install` or `uv sync` etc.

### SSH

The `catnip run` command configures SSH within the container by default. It creates a key pair named `catnip_remote` and configures a `catnip` host allowing you to run `ssh catnip` or open a remote development environment via the [Remote-SSH extension](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items/?itemName=anysphere.remote-ssh).

### Git

If you run `catnip` from within a git repo, we mount the repo into the container and create a default workspace. When you start a claude session in Catnip the system automatically commits changes as claude makes them.

> [!TIP]
> The workspace within the container is committing to a custom ref `refs/catnip/$NAME`. For convenience we also create a nicely named branch like `feature/make-something-great`. This branch is kept in sync with the workspace ref which means you can run `git checkout feature/make-something-great` outside of the container to see changes locally!

### Ports

Catnip forwards ports directly to the host system. When a service starts within the container, Catnip automatically detects and forwards the port, making it accessible at `http://localhost:$PORT`. Each workspace also has the `PORT` environment variable set to a known free port. For convenience, services can also be accessed through the Catnip UI proxy at `http://localhost:8080/$PORT`.

> [!NOTE]
> If a port isn't bindable on the host (e.g., already in use), Catnip will automatically find and use the first available port instead. The UI will notify you of the actual port being used.
